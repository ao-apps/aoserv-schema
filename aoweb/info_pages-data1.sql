Jakarta, Tomcat, servlet, jsp, engine, configuration, options	The <a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/' class='topnavlinks'>Jakarta Group's</a> Tomcat Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is AO Industries' JVM of choice for several reasons, including its compliance with Sun's Java standards and the open source nature of its code. Tomcat also has an ardent industry following, as evidenced by its strong support from the likes of Sun Microsystems and IBM.  \r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Why We Use Tomcat</b>\r\n<br><br>\r\nAs the reference implementation of Sun's Servlet and JSP specifications, Tomcat is guaranteed to be compliant with industry standards.  Tomcat 3.x supports JSDK 2.2 and JSP 1.1, while Tomcat 4.x supports JSDK 2.3 and JSP 1.2.  AO Industries supports several versions of Tomcat in order to achieve the greatest code compatibility coverage possible.  An added benefit of Tomcat being a reference implementation is that most web applications have been developed, or at least tested for standards compliance, in a Tomcat JVM.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nTomcat is a product of the Jakarta project, part of the <a href='http://apache.org/' class='topnavlinks'>Apache Software Foundation's</a> family of open source software. Having the source code readily available online has been very helpful to us, allowing us to find the optimal configurations for both performance and security.  Users can also feel confident knowing that Tomcat has benefited from the rigorous debugging and optimization performed by the large number of developers contributing to the Jakarta/Tomcat project.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nTomcat's portable code leads to the simple use of Unix (Linux) symbolic links for the installation tree. A typical Tomcat installation in the AO Industries server environment including all of our default configuration and test pages occupies around 200KB.  This small installation footprint keeps things running efficiently and reserves more space for web site content.  The RAM consumption of Tomcat is also quite reasonable, and our typical managed server is capable of running hundreds of individual Tomcat JVMs without RAM contention. \r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>How We Use Tomcat</b>\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhen sharing Tomcat 3.x JVMs, our system uses custom code that starts a separate instance of Tomcat for each site in the JVM. These sites are then optionally isolated from each other through ThreadGroups and a custom SecurityManager. This leads to very reliable and seamless operation, but the downside is each JVM creates many Threads. Each thread is represented by a native Linux process table entry, which in turn fills the process space on a normal virtual server with many thousands of processes. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAlong with the introduction of Tomcat 4, the mod_jk interface between Apache and Tomcat has proven invaluable to our overall Java hosting system.  The mod_jk module is a vast improvement over the older JServ interface in Tomcat 3.x.  Using Apache JServ Protocol 1.3 (AJP13) connectors allows persistent connections with pooling, eliminating the need to establish a new TCP connection between Apache and Tomcat for each HTTP request.  The mod_jk module also integrates better with Apache, providing more seamless environment supporting Java, PHP, CGI, and legacy systems.  Where previous protocols simply assumed that a request on port 443 was secure, mod_jk provides Tomcat with all the information necessary to correctly identify when a request was made via HTTPS. \r\n<br><br>\r\nA further minor improvement in Tomcat 4 is the integration of Catalina, a completely new code architecture that provides easier configuration and greater performance than Tomcat 3.x.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nVirtual hosting with a shared JVM in Tomcat 4 uses a combination of Apache virtual hosting and standard Tomcat virtual hosting. When an incoming connection is established, Apache resolves the correct port to connect to using AJP13. Upon connecting to Tomcat, Tomcat then performs its level of virtual hosting. Using this combination, the shared JVM allocates fewer ports and many fewer threads than our Tomcat 3 virtual hosting.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Tomcat 4 JVMs may also be security shared between clients using our custom security policies.  We use a script generated policy file for very granular security.  Each time the JVM is restarted, a Bourne shell script recreates the policy file, taking into account each JAR for each web site, granting appropriate permissions. One downside of this is that a new JAR file in a site does not receive file write permissions until the JVM is restarted.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOverall, Tomcat has proven to be a stable and efficient servlet container.  Some other products will benchmark higher.  But when examining where a reasonably complex application uses most of its time, we find that Tomcat is only a small part of the overall picture.  Taking this into account, any of the available performance increases do not out-weigh the benefits of Tomcat.\r\n

Prospective customers are seduced by the promise of reliability, only to be jabbed by the fine print quills of these legalese-laden monsters.  Below are some of the more common problems encountered when dealing with uptime guarantees.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe psychological effect of the uptime guarantee is that it makes the consumer feel safe in doing business with the hosting provider.  Percentage points and fractions thereof imply a certain level of scientific or mathematical rigor at work in producing the uptime guarantee.  It is as if hosting companies want the consumer to think that they've earned the right to offer the guarantee by running the gauntlet of strenuous laboratory testing.  Imagine the scene: in a clean room deep underground a pair of geeky types wearing white lab coats and carrying clipboards pace slowly around the humming, blinking server box, waiting for it to fail.  Back here in reality there is no such testing going on.  Hosting companies can (and often do) arbitrarily guarantee any reliability rating, up to and including 100% uptime.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhile the strings of nines may sound too good to be true, the holy grail of 100% guaranteed uptime is simply ludicrous.  For comparison, NASA demands a mere 99.999% reliability from their hardware vendors, and Sun Microsystems? $160,000 Netra FT line of servers achieves greater than 99.999% (but still less than 100%) uptime.  Yet somehow hosting companies are willing to guarantee something <I>they know they cannot provide.</I>  Furthermore, the fine print almost invariably allows for up to 20 minutes of downtime per month, effectively reducing the guarantee to a pointless tautology: "We guarantee that when we are not down, we will be up 100% of the time."<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMany times, uptime guarantees are offered as "incentive" for the hosting company to do their job right.  Why should the hosting company need additional incentive to do things correctly and keep their clients satisfied?  Customer satisfaction and the resultant timely payment for services rendered should really be incentive enough.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nUptime guarantees normally provide little in the way of compensation for downtime, and present too many hoops for the client to jump through to obtain it.  The uptime guarantee of one hosting company states that it does not apply to accounts hosted on systems using Microsoft Windows operating systems?.  Apart from the obvious Microsoft joke therein, it makes you wonder why the company would use an OS that they have such little faith in.  Understandably, this type of diligence protects the hosting company from unscrupulous clients looking to cash in on network burps, but it also gives the hosting company more "wiggle-room" in violating the spirit of the guarantee.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIn short, uptime guarantees do not in any way ensure that your website will not go down.  Rather than promising you the world should your site become inaccessible, a responsible hosting company should make you aware of what they do to prevent downtime.  Failover systems, power backups, load balancing, and network clustering all go a long way toward minimizing downtime, and any reputable business should compensate the customer for poor service without the guarantee.<BR>\r\n

A <CODE>.htaccess</CODE> file is a hidden file that, when present in a directory, overrides the default Apache configuration directives.  This feature allows individual accounts to customize their Apache configuration, while maintaining account security.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nConfiguring basic authentication typically requires three steps.

We suggest using the default group file located at <CODE>/www/<I>site_name</I>/conf/group</CODE>.<BR>\r\n  <BR>\r\n  The group file contains one line per group.  Each line consists of a group name, immediately followed by a single colon, then a space-separated list of users in the group.  The default group file defines one group, called "developer", which is used to protect the Analog log file reports.\r\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\r\n<B>Protect a Directory or a Set of Files</B>\r\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\r\n  When protecting some resources, you must first decide who can access the resource.  To avoid the tedium of maintaining the group file, people will commonly grant permission to all users in the password file.  This is done through the <CODE>require valid-user</CODE> directive.  Access may be restricted to a list of users with the <CODE>require user <I>username</I> [<I>username</I>] ...</CODE> directive.  Finally, access may be restricted to specific groups using the <CODE>require group <I>group_name</I> [<I>group_name</I>] ...</CODE> directive.<BR>\r\n  <BR>\r\n  Once you determine who can have access, you need to specify what you are protecting.  You may protect an entire directory, a specific list of files, or a set of files based on a regular expression.  To protect the entire directory, your <CODE>.htaccess</CODE> file would look like this:\r\n<PRE>\r\nAuthGroupFile /www/<I>site_name</I>/conf/group\r\nAuthUserFile /www/<I>site_name</I>/conf/passwd\r\nAuthName "<I>Prompt displayed when asking for password</I>"\r\nAuthType Basic\r\nrequire group <I>group_name</I>\r\n</PRE>\r\n  You may also selectively protect files using the <CODE><A class='aoLightLink' href='../docs/apache-1.3.22/mod/core.html#files'>Files</A></CODE> and <CODE><A class='aoLightLink' href='../docs/apache-1.3.22/mod/core.html#filesmatch'>FilesMatch</A></CODE> directives.

While this list is not exhaustive, implementing\r\nthese suggestions will make it extremely difficult for unauthorized individuals\r\nor groups to gain access to information you would like to keep secure.\r\nReally and truly, security is (mostly) a matter of common sense. Very little\r\nin this list will come as a surprise to anyone. The trick is consistent\r\nimplementation and development of good security habits.\r\n@END_LIGHT_AREA<BR>\r\n@BEGIN_LIGHT_AREA\r\n<b>Passwords and Certificates/PKI</B>\r\n<BR>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  All confidential information should be password protected (and probably\r\n  encrypted). Computers that house such information should require users\r\n  to enter a password at startup (BIOS password) and logon, or any time they\r\n  access the information you wish to keep secure. It is also a good idea\r\n  to use screensavers that lock and require the use of a password to unlock,\r\n  as this helps prevent unauthorized access of information while the user\r\n  is away without forcing the user to completely log out of the computer.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<b>Strong Passwords</b>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  Don't use weak passwords. Examples of weak passwords:\r\n  <br><br>\r\n  <CODE>Jamie</CODE> (someone's name)<BR>\r\n  <CODE>JFSebas1</CODE> (someone's user ID)<BR>\r\n  <CODE>AOIndustries</CODE> (company name)<BR>\r\n  <CODE>monsters</CODE> (dictionary word)<BR>\r\n  <CODE>B2pxQ</CODE> (too short)<br>\r\n  <BR><BR>\r\n  Strong passwords should be gibberish, no less than eight (8) characters\r\n  long, and contain letters (lower and uppercase) and numbers. Examples of\r\n  strong passwords:\r\n  <BR><BR>\r\n  <CODE>Hp46nQu2</CODE><BR>\r\n  <CODE>5i921gGe4zJ8y1</CODE><BR>\r\n  <br><br>\r\n  While strong passwords may seem somewhat difficult to remember and type,\r\n  they will go a very long way in keeping your information away from prying\r\n  eyes. Clients for whom security is a priority should also make it a policy\r\n  to change their passwords at least once a month. Never reuse your password\r\n  (e.g. don't use the same password for logging on to your computer and\r\n  accessing your account information). And don't use rotating password lists.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<b>Don't disseminate passwords</b>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  While this seems like it should be a no-brainer, you would be amazed\r\n  at how quickly most people will give out their passwords. To give you an\r\n  idea:\r\n  <BR><BR>\r\n  In an interview with one of the more infamous crackers, an interviewer\r\n  asked the cracker how he managed to bypass the security of so many corporations.\r\n  Everyone, including the interviewer, was expecting to be hit with some\r\n  great code-cracking secret. They were quite surprised when the cracker\r\n  responded, simply "People." After a dramatic pause, the cracker gleefully\r\n  continued to explain how all he had to do was call the front desk of some\r\n  company. Once the operator/secretary answered the phone, he would ask to\r\n  be transferred to maintenance. As soon as someone in maintenance answered\r\n  the phone, the cracker would then ask to be transferred to accounting (or\r\n  some other appropriate department). As soon as someone in the accounting\r\n  department picked up the phone, the cracker was set. All he had to do was\r\n  pretend to be a person in maintenance and tell the accountant that he needed\r\n  to fix some files which required the use of the accountant's password.\r\n  According to the cracker's recollection, he said he would be given the\r\n  password about 80% of the time.\r\n  <BR><BR>\r\n  LESSON: People in maintenance don't need passwords. In fact, nobody\r\n  but YOU needs your password. Since only YOU need your password, don't give\r\n  it to anyone else - regardless of who they say they are. To the best of\r\n  our knowledge, no one has ever been reprimanded for NOT giving out their\r\n  password.\r\n  <BR><BR>\r\n  The only exception to this rule concerns the possible use of encryption.\r\n  If you encrypt corporate data with a private key, your maintenance folks\r\n  may want the key just in case you get hit by a bus or something.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<B>Be aware of who is physically present when you enter your password</B>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  If you don't want the person standing behind you to know your password,\r\n  ask them to back off or look away. Simple? Yes. Often implemented? No.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<b>Don't keep passwords and encryption keys on the same computer as the\r\ndata it protects</b>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  For people looking to compromise your data, finding a file full of passwords\r\n  and encryption keys is like winning the lottery - except it's your money they're \r\n  getting. The best place to keep password lists is on paper, in a safe - or at \r\n  least in something with a lock on it. Keeping such information on Personal \r\n  Information Managers is generally not a good idea because they are small and \r\n  easy to misplace/steal. The same holds true for laptops.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<b>Keep user, file, and directory permissions set in such a way that only \r\nauthorized users have access to confidential information</b>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  Though this procedure is fairly self-explanatory, it is a little more technical \r\n  and requires both an operating system and personnel with the ability to \r\n  manipulate file and directory properties.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<b>Remove unneeded accounts</b>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  It is not uncommon for an unneeded account to sit around for months (or possibly\r\n  even years) before being removed from a computer. Such accounts are just another\r\n  way for unauthorized individuals to seek access to your information. For this \r\n  reason it is important to delete these accounts as soon as it is clear they will\r\n  no longer be needed.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<b>Use Secure Shell and Secure FTP to our server whenever possible</b>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  When connecting to any machine (or in this case, our machine) it is always a \r\n  very good idea to use an encrypted protocol such as Secure Shell, Secure FTP, \r\n  or HTTPS. Utilizing secure connection protocols prevents you from having to send\r\n  passwords in a way that is easily observed, and helps prevent the possible \r\n  compromise of information you wish to keep private.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<B>Basic physical security</B>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  Physical security does not necessarily mean hiring thick-necked thugs\r\n  to threaten people with bodily harm for standing in the wrong place at\r\n  the wrong time, though depending on your budget we suppose it could. For\r\n  most people, physical security is simply a matter of remembering to lock\r\n  doors and file cabinets at the end of the day.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<b>Laptops</b>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  Laptops, like PIMs, are small. This makes them convenient for both the\r\n  individuals who own them and the individuals who would like to own them\r\n  by means of theft. If you're lucky, the thief will only pawn your new tech\r\n  for beer money. If you're not, well... you can probably use your imagination.\r\n  For this reason maintaining close physical proximity to your portable computer\r\n  gear is very important. Be especially mindful in airports, as that's where\r\n  most thefts occur. It's 10:00 p.m., do you know where your laptop is?\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<b>Power down</b>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  Locking doors and file cabinets isn't the only thing you should do at\r\n  the end of the day. Shutting down your computer is also a good idea. Not\r\n  only does this help lower your power bill, it makes it harder for people\r\n  to access your computer while you're gone. Remember that part earlier about\r\n  setting your BIOS and logon passwords? This holds especially true for computers\r\n  that maintain a constant, static connection to the internet. It's hard\r\n  to crack a computer when it doesn't have any electricity running through\r\n  it.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<b>Keep virus scanners updated and running at all times</b>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  You can never go wrong with virus scanners. Keep them up and active\r\n  every second your computer is on. You never know when they're going to\r\n  catch something. Also, make sure the "auto update" options are switched\r\n  on. This will make the upkeep of your virus scanning software more convenient\r\n  and, at the same time, provide better protection.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<b>Don't open anonymous email attachments</B>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  It's never a good idea to open a file you get via email, period - regardless of \r\n  whom it's from. If you MUST open attachments, don't do it on a machine that \r\n  holds important information, and at least have some idea who sent the file.\r\n  Remember the Melissa virus?\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<B>Maintain the newest versions of your software</B>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  Companies are constantly coming out with patches and newer versions of software.\r\n  Usually this is because there was a problem with the older version and they've \r\n  fixed it, though sometimes it's just because they want more money. In the former\r\n  case, it's usually a good idea to purchase or download the update/patch \r\n  (assuming it is cost effective). This is especially true for patches to programs\r\n  which deal with the Internet and security. Keeping such files current helps \r\n  users stay ahead of the vulnerability curve.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n

However, these services have been the target\r\nof distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and an attack on their DNS servers would cause our email services\r\nto timeout and become unusable.  To still use their filters but not depend on their DNS servers, we now perform bulk-transfers\r\nof blacklist data from several sources.  We then combine this data into our own database of blocked IP addresses,\r\ncurrent comprised of around 5.5 million IP addresses and ranges.  Each mail server then downloads this list of blocked\r\nIP addresses and performs its real-time blacklist lookup locally.  This way, we get the benefits of\r\nthe blacklist service without depending on their servers.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<B>Content-based filters (SpamAssassin)</B><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<A class='aoDarkLink' href='http://spamassassin.apache.org/index.html'>SpamAssassin</A> is our content-based email filter\r\nof choice.  Per account, you may disable SpamAssassin, have it set headers (POP3 mode), or have it set headers and deliver the\r\nmessage to the Junk IMAP folder (IMAP mode).  We have even modified our IMAP server to automatically train the\r\nSpamAssassin Bayesian filters based on your email activity.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<HR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<B>How do I enable SpamAssassin and train its Bayesian filters?</B><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<HR>\r\n<OL>\r\n  <LI>\r\n    Enable SpamAssassin using either the settings area of our\r\n    <A class='aoDarkLink' href='@URL(com.aoindustries.website.clientarea.webmail.WebMail)'>WebMail</A> interface\r\n    or the <A class='aoDarkLink' href='@URL(com.aoindustries.website.clientarea.control.email.Inboxes)'>Email Inbox Control Panel</A>.\r\n    Select the "IMAP" level of SpamAssassin integration.\r\n  </LI>\r\n  <LI>Configure the mail client of your choice to use the IMAP protocol.</LI>\r\n  <LI>If needed, create and/or subscribe to the "Junk" and "Trash" IMAP folders.</LI>\r\n  <LI>If you have the option, configure your mail client to delete messages by moving the messages to the "Trash" folder.</LI>\r\n  <LI>When junk email arrives in your inbox, simply drag it to the "Junk" folder to train SpamAssassin.</LI>\r\n  <LI>\r\n    SpamAssassin will automatically deliver messages it considers spam to your "Junk" folder.  If any message\r\n    is incorrectly placed in this folder, simply drag it to your inbox (or any folder other than Trash, Drafts,\r\n    Sent, and Sent Items) and SpamAssassin will learn that similar messages are legitimate.\r\n  </LI>\r\n  <LI>\r\n    When deleting legitimate messages, please place it into your "Trash" folder.  Those who use a mail client\r\n    without the option to automatically do this will need to drag the messages to the "Trash" folder instead\r\n    of deleting directly to properly train the Bayesian filters.\r\n  </LI>\r\n</OL>\r\n<HR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<B>What are the other advantages of using IMAP instead of POP3?</B><BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<HR>\r\n<OL>\r\n  <LI>\r\n    The files remain on the server.

If you accidentally delete some messages or folders\r\n    they may be retrieved and placed back into your account.\r\n  </LI>\r\n  <LI>\r\n    You may concurrently share the account between multiple people, machines, and interfaces.
