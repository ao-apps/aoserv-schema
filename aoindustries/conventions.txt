1) Numeric generated primary keys named "id"

2) Tables named capitalized and singular, matching Java class name

3) Tables names never all caps for word, "IpAddress" instead of "IPAddress".
   "IPAddress" becomes bean "iPAddress".

4) Non-foreign key columns lower camelCase, matching Java field and JavaBeans getters.

5) Foreign key columns named capital, matching the name of the table they reference.
   This connects well to AOSH dot-join syntax:
       select Package.name from Username

6) Boolean columns should be "isSomething", matching the Java conventions.
   On the Java side, the field should also be "isSomething", with a getter
   "isSomething()" and setter of "setSomething(boolean isSomething)".

7) Not strictly required, but good idea to avoid Java keywords in column names,
   as this can save the overhead of manually declaring JavaBeans properties and
   JSP EL expressions such as obj['public'] where obj.public wouldn't work.
